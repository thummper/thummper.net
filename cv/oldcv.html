                    <br> Learning is a pretty big hobby of mine - I've been doing it all my life. I enjoy picking up new things and usually do so relatively quickly. Challenging concepts are satisfying to grasp so whenever things get tough I try to double down and push through.
                    <br>
                    <br> I've only scratched the surface of programming, but I just can't describe the satisfaction of bringing my ideas to life right before my eyes - making breakthroughs in code at night and watching a shoddy UI slowly develop into a fully functional system is just incredible.
                    <br>
                    <br> This year I ended up being the project manager for the majority of my team projects module. This was my first time programming something meaningful with other people - we had to develop a support helpdesk website. I really enjoyed this module because managing real people was something I had not done much before. I set up all of our project initialisation documents, booked meetings, planned agendas. We broke up the project into smaller tasks on Trello and got the work done. I wasn't hopeful when the module started, we were a completely random team while others worked with friends, but we all pulled together and it worked out nicely.
                    <br>
                    <br> During 6th form I participated and led a team of 4 in the IFS Student Investor challenge - this ignited a passion for data - I enjoy data analytics. Processing data in such a way to receive substantial insights is very cool.
                    <br>
                    <br> In 6th form I also helped out in ICT lessons whenever I was free and able - I mainly acted as a teacher's aide, so during classes I'd answer any queries children had (mainly about using new software packages) to reduce the teacher's workload.
                    <br> I also tutored Physics during lunchtime to anyone who needed extra help. During my first year I helped GCSE students and in my second year I helped AS students.
                    <br>
                    <br> I am usually a reserved person but I can thrive working individually or in team environments. My passion is creating and I will always do the best that I can. I just need a company to do my best for. When you need somebody to do something, I want to be the guy you think of first.
