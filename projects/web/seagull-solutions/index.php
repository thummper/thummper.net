                        Did you know that seagulls are the leading cause of noise pollution in seaside towns? <br> Seagulls are known to steal food from other birds, people or animals. Occasionally, they'll eat members of their own species. <br> Say "No" to seagulls - call us now.

                    At Seagull Solutions we pride ourselves in providing the most humane method of seagull disposal in the industry - we use flamethrowers. Our excessive R&amp;D budget has led to the development of the most effective seagull killing flamethrowers in the field and has also reached some breakthroughs in the flamethrower attachment scene. We now have the capability to roast seagulls from a maximum range of 150m.
                    <br> Package 3 would be ideal for a summer BBQ without the need for a BBQ - just arrange the date and we'll leave the perfectly roasted corpses behind for you to enjoy.

                        After learning to accept the 500 pigeons that moved into my apartment as my own children I came across seagull solutions. We worked out a deal over the phone and showed up the week after. My insurence covered the fire damage and my fridge has been stocked full of pigeon ever since.
